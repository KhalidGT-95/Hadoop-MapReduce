silly girl answered afraid	
take home bring Lina	
let sit next soon done frog	
fancy card playing gone struck dead	
knocked head must rip	
proud ill behaved scorned ask advice	
shall treat huntsman said Give old

dost thou feel wisdom comes unto thee Rest peace	
killed dragon would torn

vain someone would tell	
could want peasants made minds	
worthy friend seem good sort fellow help	
could find money pocket whenever put hand	
wants emperor Go home said fish emperor	
suppose go together mountains eat many	
little pigeon morning sun shining	
soon managed must asked peasant	
would great thing contrive	
little dirty hole belong fiddler said	
fears Yes father answered	
matter look quite spirits Ah	
want grindstone rest come one	
shall soon learn shudder shall die	
Ah poor child come murderers den betrothed
